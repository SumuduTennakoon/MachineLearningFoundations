## Course Description

Machine-Learning enables us to uncover trends and patterns hidden in data and make predictions based on historical observations. Machine-Learning is crucial in implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and helps industry and academia in complex problem-solving, predictive analytics, natural language processing, automation, etc. Therefore, Machine-Learning is an essential skill a Data Science and related technical professionals should carry in their toolboxes. 

This course aims to provide a fundamental understanding of the core principles of Machine Learning (ML) with hands-on training on applying machine learning to solve real-world problems. A learner who completes this course should be able to define a machine learning problem, understand the solution path, and display the ability to carry out the end-to-end process of building a machine learning application.
